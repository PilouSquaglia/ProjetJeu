# Projet Civilization

Deroulement du jeu:

Each player begins with one settler and one military unit(warrior) in a random area of the map.
The player will then decide where to found his first city using the settler(the settler will disappear upon executing that action)
This city will claim the surrounding terrain(adjacent tiles) and incorporate their resources(food, production,...) It then becomes possible to produce 
new units and infrastructure(districts) using the city's production.

If a project costs 10 production and the city has 2, the project will take 5 turns to complete

Military units can defend a city or conquer others, civilian units can found(settlers) or develop(builders) cities

Infrastructure changes the city's stats, like production(industrial zone), gold income(commercial hub), science generated(campus), culture generated(Theater square),
defense, food and housing(city center)

Some stats are specific to a city, like production or food generated while others affect the whole civilization, like science and culure

Science and culture unlock new technlologies and government policies that give bonuses and allow the creation of better units/infrastructure

A player may decide to develop his city's infrastructure first, or build military units to defend it or produce a new settler that will be used to found
another city.

These decisions will depend on the player's chosen strategy

The game ends when one player satisfies one of the victory conditions

Victory conditions:
-science victory: unlock all the technologies in the game
-culture victory: unlock all the government policies in the game
-military victory: control 51% of all cities in the game
